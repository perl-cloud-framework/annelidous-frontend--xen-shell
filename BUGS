Reporting Bugs
--------------

  If you're using the Debian package of this shell then
 please consider reporting your bug via the Debian bug
 tracking system - this will allow all users to see it
 and should speed fixing it.

  Failing that you may use the xen-tools mailing list:

        http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-shell/lists.html

  If you're capable of fixing it yourself a patch is appreciated,
 and a test case would be a useful bonus.
